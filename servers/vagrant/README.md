Use this directory for your Vagrant configuration, if any.  The
deploy script looks for the `vagrant` configuration name to enable
automatic ssh access to the machine.

If you want the Vagrant configuration to use the same configuration
as on your production machine, symlink the `configuration.yml` and
`hosts` files.
